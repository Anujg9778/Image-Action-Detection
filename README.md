# Image-Action-Detection
You saw an image and your brain can easily tell what the image is about, but can a computer tell what the image is representing? This is what you can implement in this Python based project where we will use deep learning techniques of Convolutional Neural Networks and a type of Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) together.
